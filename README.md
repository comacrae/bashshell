# bashshell
An implementation of a very simple bash-like shell
Result of a group project with two fellow students at FSU:

Sydney McGinnis:https://github.com/pepperdog80

Sophie Pavia: https://github.com/sophiepavia

COMPILATION STEPS:
run makefile and have fun! Note there are several important assumptions:
1) No more than two pipes used in a single command
2) no more than one input and output redirection in a single command
3) only four builtin functions: echo, cd, jobs, exit

Notes:
This being the most ambitious coding assignment and the first group project I've participated in, there are several bugs, but I'm very proud of what my group was able to accomplish given the limitations of online learning and our busy schedules.
